Leads
=======
Lead management is an important part of any sales process. When you get information about someone who might be interested in your products or services, but haven’t yet verified their interest or fit for your business, you’ll add them to `Workice CRM <https://workice.com/>`_ on the Leads section.

Once you’ve determined a lead is qualified, you’ll convert the lead and Workice will create a sales opportunity(deal), a contact, and an organization for you.

Leads could be obtained through a purchased contact list, a form on your website, trade shows and meetings where you’ve gathered business cards, and other marketing efforts. You can create leads in a few different ways:

- Enter them on the Leads section manually.
- Import them from a CSV or Excel file.
- Email integrations. Create new leads whenever you receive a new email.
- Use zappier to scan business cards using `<https://www.fullcontact.com/>`_ and send POST data to your Workice CRM.
- Add a Web to Lead form to your website so visitors can submit their own information.
- If you have technical resources, you can also add leads through Workice CRM API.

.. TIP:: You can choose how to view leads ie. **Kanban view** or **Table View** by selecting the Table icon on the leads page.

.. TIP:: To add lead stages, go to **Settings** - **Lead Settings** and click on **Stages** button.

.. TIP:: Mass email the leads by selecting the check boxes corresponding to the records and clicking on the Send Mail button. ``You will need to view the leads as a table``
