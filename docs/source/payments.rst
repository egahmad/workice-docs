Payments
========

Workice CRM handles your entire freelance invoicing process – from sending estimate, to invoicing your client, to receiving payment. What’s more, you can receive payments directly and automatically via workice supported gateways enabling totally smooth management of your customer accounts using your choice of payment provider.

Payments List
""""""""""""""

The Payments list page displays a summary of all payments once they have been received. Payments are recorded in two ways:

1. **Automatic payment**: If your client has paid you via any of the supported payment gateways, the payment will be automatically recorded in the Payments list. You will be notified on your dashboard page in the notification section, and also via email (if you have enabled notification).
2. **Manual payment**: If your client has paid you via cash, check, bank transfer, credit card or any other payment system not linked to Workice CRM, you will need to enter the payment manually on the Payments / Create page.

Whether automatic or manual entry, the Payments list page presents an overview of all payments received in a user-friendly table format. Now, we’ll take you through the various columns in the Payments table from left to right:

- **Code**: Transaction reference number.
- **Client Name**: The client's name
- **Payment Date**: The date the payment was received
- **Invoice Date**: The date the invoice was issued.
- **Amount**: The payment amount that was received
- **Method**: The method of payment used, ie. PayPal, Bank Transfer, Visa, etc

Partial Payments
""""""""""""""""
Accepting partial online payments is simpler than you think. Your customer has the option to enter an amount less than the invoice amount while making online payment. Once the amount is successfully processed, it’s applied to the invoice and the status of the invoice is updated to "Partially Paid". There 3 options a client can pay a partial payment;

1. **Minimum Due**: The customer can choose to pay minimum amount due to keep the account current.
2. **Full Amount**: Client can pay the full invoice amount
3. **Other Amount**: Customer enters the amount to pay in the input.
