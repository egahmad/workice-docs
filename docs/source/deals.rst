Clicking on the “Deals” tab in Workice CRM takes you to our comprehensive CRM, a feature exclusive to our Small Business and Enterprise plans.

.. TIP:: You can choose the deal view type ie. **Kanban view** or **Table View** by selecting the Table icon on the deals page.

What are deals?
"""""""""""""""
Think of deals as a way of identifying qualified leads as sales opportunities. Deals are contacts that no longer sit dormant in your database; they’re actually in your pipeline and are on track to become customers.
When a deal is created it is assigned to an internal team member who monitors and manages the movement of deals from stage to stage in your pipelines.

What are pipelines?
"""""""""""""""""""
Pipelines are your business processes — sales-related and otherwise. For example, sales pipelines could be "Orders" or "Sales" They represent the entire process of converting qualified leads into customers.

You can setup as many pipelines (or processes) as necessary for your business since Workice CRM does not limit the amount of active pipelines you can create.

.. TIP:: To add pipelines, go to **Settings** - **Deal Settings** and click on **Sales Pipelines** button.

What are stages?
""""""""""""""""
Pipelines contain stages. If pipelines are your processes, stages are the steps that deals must advance through to complete those processes (and in many cases, for you to close sales).

For example, stages could be "Need To Contact" and "Currently In Contact" and "Send Proposal".  

.. TIP:: Click the Settings icon in the upper right corner of the deals page to add more stages.

**Open** deals are those that are active. **Won** deals are those that achieve the goal of the pipeline (e.g. buy a product or are successfully on-boarded). **Lost** deals are leads that enter your pipelines but do not convert.
