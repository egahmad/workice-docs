Time Entry
""""""""""""

There are two ways to record time spent on a task: Timer and Manual.

Timer
^^^^^

This is an automatic timer feature that allows you to record working sessions in real time. To begin the timer, press Start. Then get to work. The timer will run until you select Stop.
When you select Stop, the timer will be stopped and the time entry can be viewed in **Timesheets** section of the task page.

Manual
^^^^^^

The other way you can create a time entry is by manual entry of the session details. 

 - To enter time manually click on **Time Entry** button. 
 - Select a task from the dropdown list (optional).
 - Enter time in the format {hours}:{minutes}:{seconds} i.e 01:10:30 means 1 hour, 10minutes and 30 seconds.
 - Alternatively, you can choose a start time and end time by checking **Use start and End Dates** checkbox.
 - Enter time entry description and choose whether it's billable or unbillable.

Recurring Tasks
""""""""""""""""
You can create recurring tasks for tasks you have to do again and again as part of a single project.
Before setting a repeat, you will first need to make sure you have a due date set on the task.

When editing the task, you will see the **Recur Every** field and under this field you can choose when the task should repeat:

You can set a repeat interval such as ``daily, week, month, quarter, six months, year``.

Once you have chosen the interval, you can decide for the repeat to stop by a particular date.

.. Note:: Any files attached to the original task will not carry over to each future repeating task.

.. TIP:: To stop a recurring task, edit the task and change **Recur Every** field to **None**.

.. TIP:: Reminders are sent based on the due date of the task.
