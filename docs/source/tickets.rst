Tickets are the means through which your end users (customers) communicate with agents in your support system. `Workice <https://workice.com>`__ support system allows you to present a web portal to your customers to create, track, and respond to support requests.
Regardless of the type of customer support you provide, the one constant for all support organizations is that customers seek you out to help them resolve their issues. 

Here are some of the options that your customers have for contacting you:
 - Send an email
 - Fill out a support request form in your Workice Support portal
 - Fill out a support request form on your own web site (Use Ticket API)

.. NOTE:: By default, a comment you enter as a Public Reply will be public and visible to everyone who views this ticket, including the person who requested support. You can also add private comments (referred to as an Internal Note). The requester never sees these notes, they are used for internal communication only. For example, an agent may need to get advice from another agent to solve the requester's support issue. 

If you want to add an internal note, start your comment with **[NOTE]**

Example internal note;

.. code-block:: shell

	[NOTE] My internal note comment
