Estimates allow you to create and send an approximate outline of your Items or Freelancer Services to your Client for approval before beginning the work. The client can then Accept the Estimate for approval before converting it into an Invoice automatically, or you can go ahead and convert it yourself to start collecting payment!

Estimates List
"""""""""""""""
As a freelancer, many jobs – whether big or small – will begin as an estimate. How so? Well, a client expresses interest in your skills or product, but wants to know how much it’s going to cost, in advance. With the estimates feature of `Workice <https://workice.com>`__, you can easily create a price estimate and send it to the client up front, helping them make the decision to commit, and helping you keep track of your projected work schedule and income.

Once the price quote is accepted by the client, `Workice <https://workice.com>`__ enables automatic creation of an invoice that imports all the estimate data, so your estimates and invoices are linked, organized and easily traceable.

To view your estimates list page, click the **Accounting** tab on the main sidebar, and select Estimates from the drop-down menu. This will open the Estimates list page.

The estimates list table contains the columns below:

- **Estimate**: The number of the estimate

To create a new estimate, go to the Estimates tab on the main sidebar, and click on the **Create** button. This will open the Estimates / Create page offering a series of text and numerical inputs.

Note that each new estimate you create will be automatically numbered in chronological order. This will ensure your records are kept logical and organized. (You have the option to change the estimate number manually in **Settings** - **Estimate Settings**).

The form contains:

- **Title**: Estimate Title e.g Acme Website Design (optional)
- **Client**: Click on the arrow at the right end of the Client field. Select the relevant client from the client list.
- **Due Date**: The date when the estimate should expire. 
- **Currency**: Estimate currency.

Once you've completed creating your estimate, click on **Save** Button and you'll be redirected to the estimate page where you can enter your products/services.

- **Item/Product**: This is the name of the item you are billing for. You can either enter the details manually, or start typing and pick already invoiced items.

- **Unit Price**: The amount you charge per unit of items. For example, let's say your item is "1 hour consulting", and you charge $80 for an hour of consulting – that is, for 1 item unit. Then you'll enter 80 in the Unit Price field.

.. Note:: If you have selected a set item from the auto complete list, the description and unit price that you pre-defined in your previous invoice will apply by default. You can manually override the default unit price or description by clicking in field and changing the data.

- **Quantity**: The number of units being charged. Continuing the above example, let's say you need to charge for 3 hours of consulting, enter the number 3 in the Quantity field.
