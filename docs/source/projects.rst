Projects

If you have Staff in your account, their rate is how much your Client will be billed regardless of the Task the hours are logged against. This method is really useful if you have multiple Staff working on a Project all with different rates.

Hourly Task Rate
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Your Client will be billed based on the Tasks that are assigned to the Project. It doesn’t matter who tracked the time, only the **Task Rate** is being taken into consideration. This method is really useful if you charge different rates for different Tasks regardless of who did the work.

Hourly Project Rate
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
It doesn’t matter who tracked the time, or which Task was chosen, your Client will always be billed at one consistent rate for that Project.

Fixed Project Amount
